High-performance computing (HPC) clusters offer researchers an opportunity to
perform work that would be impossible with ordinary computers. In this
three-hour hands-on workshop, you will learn the basics of supercomputers and
how to use them: finding and loading scientific software, performing
calculations in batch jobs or interactive sessions, storing and managing data,
and using resources efficiently and responsibly.

> ## Note
>
> - This is the draft HPC Carpentry release, with modifications for use on the
>   Plato HPC cluster at the University of Saskatchewan. Comments and feedback
>   are welcome.
