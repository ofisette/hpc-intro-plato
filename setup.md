## General

Attendees are expected to have completed the [Introduction to the Linux command
line](https://wiki.usask.ca/x/CoAObw) workshop, or have equivalent skills.

## SSH

Attendees must bring a laptop with a terminal and SSH capabilities. We can help
attendees prepare their laptop on request.

- **Linux:** Terminal and SSH client are built in.

- **Apple macOS:** Terminal and SSH client are built in.

- **Windows 10, recently updated (build 1809):** The PowerShell terminal and SSH
  client are built in. If you prefer, you can use MobaXterm or Putty instead
  (see the next entry).

- **Older Windows:** Install MobaXterm
  ([http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net)). Choose “Home
  edition (Installer edition)” on the download page. Alternatively, you can
  use PuTTY ([https://www.putty.org](https://www.putty.org/)). On Windows 10
  older than build 1809, you can install OpenSSH for use in PowerShell as an
  optional Windows component.

## Campus wifi connection

Campus wifi users must be connected to the *uofs-secure* access point.

- Plato is not accessible from *uofs-guest* or *uofs-public* on campus.

- See the following IT Knowledge Base article: [How do I connect to the
  uofs-secure Wireless Network](https://wiki.usask.ca/x/cgDvXg).

## USask VPN

Remote users must be connected to the network through the USask VPN.

- Plato is not accessible from outside the campus without the VPN.

- See the following IT Knowledge Base article: [Virtual Private Network
  (VPN)](https://wiki.usask.ca/x/0YnDTg).

## Notes

Attendees will be provided with an account on the Plato cluster, an HPC system
at USask. Accounts will be created after the list of participants is finalised,
and deleted once the workshop is over. Attendees who already use Plato will use
their existing account for the workshop.
